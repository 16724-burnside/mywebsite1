The defender will destroy the drone, block the door frame or window with wood, and strengthen the wall. Face to avoid the wall being destroyed by the attacker to invade the target, the defender can also use the monitor to find the enemy position.
            
            The goal of the game is that the attacker must reach the target and reach the condition, and the defender must prevent the attacker from reaching the victory condition. In addition to destroying the wall, the attacker can also carry out the rope on the outside of the building. These destructible surfaces can also be used by the defending party to attack and exploit. The weapon in the game can hurt the teammate, and the character can't be revived until the next turn after the character dies.
            There are four ways to end the game:

            The attacker wins after reaching the condition

        <p>
            Compared with traditional football games, the Rockets League is unique. It is a bright spot to watch football games by operating vehicles. The physics engine of the game itself is great, and the driving and touch skills are also very researched, plus a variety of venues (including ice hockey, basketball) and a variety of vehicles, is a game worth buying. Yes, it’s very fun to be black with friends!
            A big difference is that traditional football games are played by people. RL is a non-nonsense game. Because the car is the main body of control, the influence of inertia and turning radius is very large, and the action is divided into forward/reverse. A few points have caused huge manipulation differences. Imagine if the player needs to slow down when playing FIFA, and then draw a semi-circle with a radius of 3 meters on the field to return to the defense, fearing that people will drop the handle XD. In general, it is a bit like the difference between playing traditional TPS and the world of tanks. On the other hand, the ball of the traditional football game and the player itself are sticky, and there is no need to worry about how to take the ball out of a straight line, and RL has no such advantage at all. The movement of the ball depends entirely on your last contact. How much force is applied to it from what angle. Coupled with the aforementioned differences in mobility control, it is enough to take some time to adapt.
